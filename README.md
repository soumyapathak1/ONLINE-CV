## Overview

My CV, created using Angular and Bootstrap

I hate using MS word, and the online tools for CV making are very restrictive, so decided to make my own

## Credits

Angular for the framework, Bootstrap for making responsiveness easy, fontawsome for icons, kickresume for colour inspiration and cv tips,  https://www.photoshopsupply.com/ for their free 'subtle patterns'
